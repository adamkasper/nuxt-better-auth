## Why Nuxt Better Auth?

Building authentication from scratch is hard. Wiring up Better Auth with Nuxt manually involves:
- Setting up API handlers
- Syncing client/server state
- Handling redirects
- Managing database schemas (if using a database)

This module does all of that for you. It's designed to be **drop-in** and **zero-config** where possible.
