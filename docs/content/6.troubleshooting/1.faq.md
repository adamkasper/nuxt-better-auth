## NuxtHub version requirement

If using NuxtHub for database features, you need `@nuxthub/core` version **0.10.0** or higher. NuxtHub is optional - see [NuxtHub Integration](/integrations/nuxthub) for details.

```bash
pnpm add @nuxthub/core@latest
```

## "Missing server/auth.config.ts"

The module validates config files at build time.
Create `server/auth.config.ts` exporting `defineServerAuth(...)`.

## "Missing app/auth.client.ts"

Create `app/auth.client.ts` exporting `createAppAuthClient(baseURL)`.

## No schema file is generated

Schema generation requires NuxtHub. Ensure NuxtHub is installed and DB is configured:

```ts
hub: { db: { dialect: 'sqlite' } }
```

Restart dev server after changing Better Auth plugins.

## `routeRules` changes don't apply

`routeRules` are synced to page meta during `pages:extend`.
Restart dev server after updating route rules.

## API routes aren't protected

Only `routeRules.role` is enforced for `/api/**`.
Use `role` rules or add your own Nitro middleware.
